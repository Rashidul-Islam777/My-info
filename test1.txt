Hi, this is Rashidul Islam. I am 24 years old. I am learing web design and development. I have already learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript and some basic PHP too. My next goals is to learn React.js, SASS, JQuery, Typescript,PHP and object oriented programming and data structures and algorith, Laravel, Python and Django, MongoDB and MySQL,Node.js and express.js etc. Within a few years I will learn them inshaallah. My ultimate aim is to be a very good programmer or an expert programmer. I know I have to work hard for that. But I am willing to give as much as effort I am able to put.
